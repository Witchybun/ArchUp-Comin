# FFPS Randomizer Setup Guide

### Required Software

- Freddy Fazbearâ€™s Pizzeria Simulator from the [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/738060/)
- Archipelago from the [Archipelago Releases Page](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)
    - (select `FFPS Client` during installation.)

### First time setup

Start the FFPS client, and in the bottom text box, input `/patch`, it will then make an FFPS Game folder that will be created in the
Archipelago install location. That contains the version of FFPS you will use for Archipelago, the one called `FFPS Mod`. (You will need to
redo this step when updating Archipelago.)

### Connect to the MultiServer

Make sure both FFPS and its client are running.

In the top text box of the client, type the 
`Ip Address` (or `Hostname`) and `Port` separated with a `:` symbol. (Ex. `archipelago.gg:38281`)

The client will then ask for the slot name, input that in the text box at the bottom of the client.

### Play the game

When the console tells you that you have joined the room, you're all set. Congratulations on successfully joining a
multiworld game!

### Where do I get a YAML file?

You can customize your settings by visiting the [FFPS Player Settings Page](/games/FFPS/player-settings)
